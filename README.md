Adding commentend it is really difficult for static sites, this is an easy way to add commenting section to a static
people being able.
this probably would an eay saas solution that your cann static comments to your site.


main concept that's being used here, is taking the advantage from the ISR(Incremental satatic regenaration ) provided by nextjs 
which periodically regenarates the static page in the packground. This

one of the things that we take into a consideration before building any commenting system in the spam comment, to enforce no spam  people here will login with there github or gmail. so there is a name put there plus, in the back side you will have moderation 
so we can remove comments that are not necessar.




Custom built solutions provide more control of the design, functionality and data than drop-in solutions, such as Disqus and Facebook Comments.
